# Git-GitHub

I have expanding my skills in version control and collaboration by diving into GitHub. My focus is on mastering key concepts like repositories, branches, commits, pull requests, and using GitHub Actions for automation. Through hands-on projects, I am learning how to manage and track code changes efficiently while contributing to open-source projects and working on my own Power BI development projects. This knowledge is enhancing my ability to collaborate with teams and integrate version control into my Power BI workflow.
